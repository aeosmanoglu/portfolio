> Two Factor Authentication is a new security feature that allows you to add extra security to your account.


A `NodeJs/Express` web application generates a secret and displays it to the user with a QR code on the screen. Verifies the digits of the users with an endpoint.

1. App user interfaces developed with customized `Bootstrap 5` that with `Sass`.
1. Users log in to the app with active directory credentials over LDAP.
1. Users' data is encrypted with AES-256 and saved in `MongoDB`.
1. `Docker` is used to deploy the app.

A `Flutter` mobile application that captures the secret from the QR code with the device camera produces time or hash-based one-time password digits. Acts like Google or Microsoft authenticator app.

1. Stores all secrets in a local encrypted database. Database key stores in the device's KeyChain or KeyStore.
1. You cannot run the app in Rooted or Jailbreaked devices for security reasons.
1. No cloud storage or internet connection is required.
