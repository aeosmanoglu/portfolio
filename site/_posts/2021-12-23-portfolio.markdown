Currently, I cannot share my work as open-source, as my professional life develop security priority applications for a corporate company. Thatâ€™s why I decided to set up this site with `jekyll`. App user interfaces developed with customized `Bootstrap 5` that with `Sass`.

The font I use is `JetBrains Mono`, a font made for the specific needs of developers. More information on font specifications, design, and language support can be found at [jetbrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).
